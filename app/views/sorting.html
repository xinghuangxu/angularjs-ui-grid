  Click on a column header to sort by that column. (The third column has sorting disabled.)
  To demonstrate the live sorting we provide a button that toggles the gender of Alexander Foley.
  Sort by gender (ASC - so click twice) then name (using shift click), so that Alexander is at the top of the grid,
  then click the toggleGender button.

  <br>
  <button id='toggleGender' ng-click='toggleGender()' class="btn btn-success" >Toggle Gender</button>
  <div id="grid1" ui-grid="gridOptions1" class="grid"></div>

  You can set an initial sort state for the grid by defining the `sort` property on your column definitions.
  The `direction` sub-property says which way to sort, and the `priority` says what order to sort the columns
  in (lower priority gets sorted first).
